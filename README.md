# UF-AVL-Tree
An AVL Tree that stores 8-digit UF ID numbers

### How it Works

1st line should be the amount of lines that you are typing in
The rest of the commands are as follows:
* insert (insert "John" 12345678)
- Names must contain only letters and spaces
- UFID must be 8 digits long
* printInorder (prints inorder traversal of tree)
* printPostorder (prints postorder traversal of tree)
* printPreorder (prints preorder traversal of tree)
* remove (remove 12345678)
* removeInorder (removeInorder 3 would remove the 3rd node in an Inorder traversal)
* printLevelCount (prints the amount of levels the tree has; root counts as 1)
* search (search "John" or search 12345678; search for name outputs UFID, search for UFID outputs name)
